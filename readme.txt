"Threads of Smoke"

The rain came softly, the way it always did on days when Winnie was supposed to remember something. She never noticed at first — not consciously. But there’d be a tug, a tiny insistence. A missed bus. A cracked mug. The scent of something that didn’t belong in the present.

Today, it was palo santo. A curl of smoke in a yoga studio on the west end, drifting like a ghost past the windowed mirrors.

She had just folded into child’s pose when it reached her — the sweet, earthy resin of the sacred wood. It wrapped around her like memory, warm and unmistakable. She was twenty-three again, sunburnt and barefoot in Costa Rica, tracing the grain of a hand-carved bench in a jungle Shala with sand still clinging to her ankles.

There, she’d known who she was. Not just conceptually. Viscerally. She knew what she wanted, what she feared, and how to listen to her body when it said yes or no.

Past Winnie had kept a blue journal filled with waxy ink and flower petals, each page a declaration. She danced when no one was watching, trusted her gut, and believed that rituals made life real.

This one? This version of her? She hadn’t written a word in a year and couldn’t remember the last time she’d taken a risk that didn’t come with a refund policy.

A tear slid down her cheek and vanished into the mat. She stayed in child’s pose long after the class had ended.

Later that night, she lit a candle.

The palo santo stick sat untouched beside her. She hadn’t lit one since she’d returned home years ago. It felt performative now. Like a performance of a girl who no longer lived here.

Still, she struck the match.

The flame caught, and she watched the wood smoke spiral upward in slow, deliberate loops. She realized she had forgotten how fire moved. How it began quietly and insisted on space.

She let the smoke fill the room. Then, she took out the blue journal. The old one. It was water-warped and spine-broken, but the pressed petals still held their shape. She flipped to the last used page.

On the back, in handwriting she barely recognized, she’d once written:

“When you forget who you are, start where you lost the thread. There’s always a way back.”

So she wrote beneath it, slowly:

“I lost the thread in fear of wanting more.”

Then, a little bolder:

“I’m coming back for it.”

She dug through a box in the back of her closet until she found the shell anklet she’d bought from a laughing vendor on the beach. The clasp was rusted. She put it on anyway.

She sat.

She listened.

Not for answers.

But for herself.
